Good kid is band of five programmers that met at the university of Toronto while studying computer science. They have played their brand of fast paced indie rock in New York, LA, and Toronto and are super excited to play NeuRIPS! During the daytime Nick Frosst (vocals) works at Google Brain where he focuses on adversarial examples and capsule networks. He has been trying to convince the other members to abandon their respective fields to get in on the deep learning hype, but so far he has only convinced Jon (drums).

[Charles](https://onucharles.wordpress.com/about/) will be performing at NeurIPS for the second year in a row. He sings, plays the piano and the acoustic guitar. Neither of the 3 was learnt professionally but he might have learnt how to fake it. You'll find some of his performances on [his facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/onucharlesc/videos/). Recently he has been learning to play the harmonica, but the tiny instrument seems to be sucking all the breath out of him. When the stars align, he usually studies as a PhD student at McGill University and Mila in Montreal. He founded [Ubenwa](http://ubenwa.ai) to leverage machine learning for low-cost medical diagnosis.
